.home__description
Hi, I'm Reiza, people call me "El Labu". I am currently trying to learn 
something new, building my own bike with parts made only in Malaysia.

Adino steals cotton candy from his brother and eats them all in one bite, 
a hungry beast. Grahami can no longer contain his anger towards Adino.

In search for cute little puppy, Captain Sem has come back from his tragic death. 
With his hogwarts certified power he promise to be a hero for all of ghostkind.
